Running a Local LLM with Your Documents on Mac
Overview
An M2 MacBook Pro with 32GB unified memory is excellent for running local LLMs. The unified memory architecture works particularly well for AI workloads.

Recommended Models for Your Hardware
Llama 3.1 8B - Fast, great quality (uses ~8GB RAM)
Llama 3.1 70B - Slower but very capable (uses ~40GB, will use swap but still runs)
Mistral 7B - Good alternative, efficient
Qwen 2.5 14B - Sweet spot for your RAM
The number (8B, 7B, etc.) indicates parameters - smaller = less RAM needed but less capable.

Option 1: Ollama + Open WebUI (Command Line)
Step 1: Install Ollama
bash
brew install ollama
Step 2: Start Ollama and Pull a Model
bash
# Start Ollama server
ollama serve

# In another terminal, pull a model
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
Step 3: Install Open WebUI
Requires Docker Desktop for Mac.

bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -v open-webui:/app/backend/data \
  --name open-webui \
  ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
Step 4: Use It
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser
Create an account (local only)
Upload documents (PDFs, text files, etc.)
Chat with your documents using the model
Option 2: LM Studio (GUI - Easiest)
Step 1: Download LM Studio
Visit https://lmstudio.ai and download for Mac.

Step 2: Download Models
Open LM Studio
Browse models in the GUI
Click download on your preferred model
Wait for download to complete
Step 3: Upload Documents and Chat
Go to the Chat tab
Upload your documents using drag-and-drop
Start chatting with your documents
LM Studio is the easiest option for Mac - no terminal commands required.

Option 3: AnythingLLM (All-in-One Solution)
Download from https://anythingllm.com

Complete GUI application
Built-in document management
Works with Ollama or built-in models
Privacy-focused
Understanding RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
When you upload documents to these tools, they're using RAG, not training:

Your documents are split into chunks
Chunks are converted to embeddings (vectors)
When you ask a question, relevant chunks are retrieved
The LLM generates an answer using those chunks as context
This means:

Your documents stay local
No training required (fast setup)
Works with any documents
Can update documents anytime
Alternative Tools for Developers
If you want to build your own solution:

LangChain - Python framework for LLM applications
LlamaIndex - Specialized for document indexing and retrieval
PrivateGPT - Privacy-focused document chat system
Quick Comparison
Tool	Difficulty	Best For
LM Studio	Easy	Beginners, GUI lovers
Ollama + Open WebUI	Medium	CLI comfortable users
AnythingLLM	Easy	All-in-one solution
LangChain/LlamaIndex	Hard	Developers building custom apps
Tips for Best Performance
Start with 8B models to test - they run fast
Close other memory-intensive apps when running larger models
The first response may be slow as models load into memory
Subsequent responses will be much faster
Your Mac's fans may spin up during inference
Recommended First Steps
Install LM Studio (easiest) or Ollama
Download Llama 3.1 8B model
Upload a few test documents
Ask questions about your documents
If satisfied, consider trying larger models like 14B or 70B
Privacy Benefits
All of these solutions:

Run completely offline after initial download
Keep your documents on your machine
Send no data to external servers
Give you full control over your data
